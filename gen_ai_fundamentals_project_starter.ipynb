        "Counting letters in a word is a surprisingly complex task for an LLM. Just as human beings would not be able to answer such a question for longer words without breaking down the word into its individual letters and then counting them, LLMs cannot be similarly expected to be able to respond without using smaller reasoning steps.\n",
